Boodler: a programmable soundscape tool
  Sound library
  Collection date: February 19, 2002 (021902)

Collected from many sources by Andrew Plotkin <erkyrath@eblong.com>

These sounds are copyrighted by their various owners. See the
copyright and usage references in each subdirectory's README file. I
have tried to collect only sounds that are free for use in
non-commercial multimedia projects (or public-domain).

A few sounds were found unattributed, through blind Web-searching. I
take the (arrogant) position that either these were used legally on
the Web, and are therefore free for non-commercial use, or else the
original creator is unfindable and therefore there is nothing I can do
about it. Since Boodler is not, in the grand scheme of the sound-using
world, a big deal, this is probably good enough.

If you wish to use a Boodler soundscape in a commercial recording, or
some other for-profit procedure that makes use of the Boodler sound
library, the copyrights are your responsibility. You must look at the
README files and ensure that before you use any sounds that say
"non-commercial use only", you contact the copyright holder for
permission.

(Alternatively, toss this sound library and use your own sounds. The
Boodler engine itself is free software under the LGPL; it is not
limited by the restrictions of this sound library. Boodler can be used
in nearly all situations, commercial and non-commercial. See the
copyright statement that comes with Boodler.)
