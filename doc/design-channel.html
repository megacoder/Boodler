<h2>Boodler: Working With Channels</h2>

As we have said, a channel is a group of agents and notes which can be
manipulated all together. In the examples above, the agents -- and therefore
all the notes -- have run in the root channel, which is created
automatically. Here is an example that creates a new channel:

<pre>
class Example(Agent):
    name = 'channel example'
    def run(self):
        chan = self.new_channel()
        self.sched_note('environ/droplet-plink.aiff', 1, 1, 0, chan)
</pre>

The <code>new_channel()</code> method creates a channel, which is
contained inside the channel that the agent is running in -- that is,
inside the root channel. We then call <code>sched_note()</code> with
five arguments: pitch, volume, time, and channel. (As usual, to provide
the fifth argument we must also give the first four.)
<p>

This plays a note inside our new channel. As you hear, this sounds exactly
the same as playing it in the root channel. 
<p>

So what's the point? Consider this example:
<p>

<pre>
class Example(Agent):
    name = 'channel example'
    def run(self):
        ag = Example2()
        loudchan = self.new_channel(1)
        self.sched_agent(ag, 0, loudchan)
        ag = Example2()
        softchan = self.new_channel(0.25)
        self.sched_agent(ag, 0.5, softchan)

class Example2(Agent):
    name = 'plink forever example'
    def run(self):
        self.sched_note('environ/droplet-plink.aiff')
        self.resched(1.0)
</pre>

The <code>Example2</code> agent repeats a plink sound once per second,
forever. <code>Example</code> creates two channels and two instances
of <code>Example2</code>, and sets them off.
<p>

We've dropped in some new optional arguments here. The first argument
of <code>new_channel()</code> is the channel volume. It defaults to
1.0, meaning (as usual) "full volume". We set the first channel
to full volume, but for the second channel we set
one-quarter volume instead. The three arguments to <code>sched_agent()</code>
are the agent, the scheduling time, and the channel. 
<p>

So the first agent runs in a full-volume channel, and starts immediately.
The second agent runs in a 25% channel, and is scheduled to start one
half-second in the future. Since each of the two agents
repeats a plink every second, you hear one every half-second, but
they alternate loud-soft-loud-soft.
<p>

(A quick footnote that doesn't really belong here: note that we 
create two instances of <code>Example2</code>. It would not be legal
to create one instance and schedule it twice:

<pre>
class Example(Agent):
    # broken! schedules an agent instance twice!
    name = 'channel example'
    def run(self):
        ag = Example2()
        loudchan = self.new_channel(1)
        self.sched_agent(ag, 0, loudchan)
        softchan = self.new_channel(0.25)
        self.sched_agent(ag, 0.5, softchan)
</pre>

No instance of an <code>Agent</code> class may wait on the schedule twice
at the same time. On the other hand, once an agent starts running, it's
off the schedule and it's legal to put it back on; this is why the
<code>resched()</code> method works.)
<p>

<h3>Changing volumes and stopping channels</h3>

In the previous example we created channels with particular volume levels.
It's also possible to change the volume of a channel as it plays.
<p>

<pre>
class Example(Agent):
    name = 'fade-out example'
    def run(self):
        ag = Example2()
        chan = self.new_channel(1)
        self.sched_agent(ag, 0, chan)
        chan.set_volume(0, 5)

class Example2(Agent):
    name = 'plink forever example'
    def run(self):
        self.sched_note('environ/droplet-plink.aiff')
        self.resched(0.5)
</pre>

We create the channel with full volume, but we then call
<code>chan.set_volume()</code>. (Note that this is a method of the
channel, not of <code>self</code>.) The first argument is the volume
to change to; the second is how long it takes to slide to that level.
We are scheduling the volume to fade from 1 (full) to 0 (silent) over
a five-second interval. The <code>Example2</code> agent runs continuously
during this time, but since it is running in the channel, its notes
are affected by the volume change.
<p>

Note that Boodler does not shut down after the five seconds are over.
<code>Example2</code> is still running and playing notes; they're just
at zero volume.
<p>

(By the way, you should never call <code>chan.set_volume()</code> 
with a zero-second fade interval. Changing the volume instantaneously produces
clicking or popping in the sound stream. If you leave off the second argument
-- for example,

<pre>
        chan.set_volume(0)
</pre>

-- then the default interval will be 0.005, or five milliseconds. This is
short enough to sound instantaneously, but long enough to prevent popping.
You should not use an interval shorter than this.)
<p>

We frequently want a soundscape that starts at zero volume, fades in,
plays for a few seconds, and then fades out. 
Unfortunately, <code>chan.set_volume()</code> does not have an argument
for <em>starting</em> time. It always schedules the volume change beginning
immediately. To schedule a volume change starting in the future, we must
create and schedule an agent.
<p>

<pre>
class Example(Agent):
    name = 'fade-in-out example'
    def run(self):
        ag = Example2()
        chan = self.new_channel(0)
        self.sched_agent(ag, 0, chan)
        chan.set_volume(1, 3)
        ag = ExampleFadeOut()
        self.sched_agent(ag, 6, chan)

class ExampleFadeOut(Agent):
    name = 'fade-out example'
    def run(self):
        chan = self.channel
        chan.set_volume(0, 3)

class Example2(Agent):
    name = 'plink forever example'
    def run(self):
        self.sched_note('environ/droplet-plink.aiff')
        self.resched(0.5)
</pre>

We create a zero-volume channel, start the plinker immediately, and
schedule a volume change from 0 to 1 over three seconds. Then we
schedule an instance of <code>ExampleFadeOut</code> to begin running
after <em>six</em> seconds. (This gives us three seconds of fade-in 
followed by three seconds of full volume.) The <code>ExampleFadeOut</code>
agent does nothing but schedule a three-second fade-out, from volume
1 to 0. After nine seconds, we are back to silence.
<p>

It would be nice if Boodler shut down after that nine-second sequence.
The <code>chan.stop()</code> method will kill a channel, and all notes
and agents running in it. (And also any channels inside that channel.)
But this method, like <code>chan.set_volume()</code>, takes effect
immediately. To delay it, we must add another agent.

<pre>
class ExampleFadeOut(Agent):
    name = 'fade-out example'
    def run(self):
        chan = self.channel
        chan.set_volume(0, 3)
        ag = ExampleStop()
        self.sched_agent(ag, 3)

class ExampleStop(Agent):
    name = 'stop example'
    def run(self):
        chan = self.channel
        chan.stop()
</pre>

(The other two agents are as before.) Note that when 
<code>ExampleFadeOut</code> schedules <code>ExampleStop</code>, it does
not need to pass a second argument to <code>sched_agent()</code>; the
default behavior is to schedule the new agent in the same channel as the
current agent, and that's the channel that <code>Example</code> creates.
<p>

Also note that the sequence of events has gotten quite elaborate.
<code>Example</code> launches two agents, one immediate and one delayed.
The immediate agent runs forever, rescheduling itself every half-second.
The delayed agent launches a third agent after yet another delay.
<p>

(We could have scheduled <code>ExampleFadeOut</code> and
<code>ExampleStop</code> both directly from <code>Example</code>, but 
this arrangement makes the soundscape easier to modify. If we wanted
to change the full-volume interlude from three seconds to five, we would
just have to change the 6 in <code>Example</code> to an 8.
<code>ExampleFadeOut</code> would run later, but it would still schedule
the <code>chan.set_volume()</code> and the <code>ExampleStop</code> at
the correct times, relative to each other.)
<p>

Actually, this sequence -- fade out and stop -- is so common that Boodler
has a built-in agent to handle it. The example above could be rewritten:

<pre>
class Example(Agent):
    name = 'fade-in-out example'
    def run(self):
        ag = Example2()
        chan = self.new_channel(0)
        self.sched_agent(ag, 0, chan)
        chan.set_volume(1, 3)
        ag = FadeOutAgent(3)
        self.sched_agent(ag, 6, chan)

class Example2(Agent):
    name = 'plink forever example'
    def run(self):
        self.sched_note('environ/droplet-plink.aiff')
        self.resched(0.5)
</pre>

The <code>FadeOutAgent</code> class is defined in Boodler's <code>agent</code>
module, which we import. We create an instance, passing the fade-out interval
(three seconds) as an argument. Then we schedule it like any other agent.
<p>

<h3>Channel limitations and rules</h3>

The <code>channel.stop()</code> method kills a channel instantaneously; any
sounds that are playing get cut off. This, like an instantaneous volume
change, can cause clicks and pops. It is wise to fade the volume to zero
before you stop the channel.
<p>

(In fact, since <code>FadeOutAgent</code> does both these things, it's
just wise to use <code>FadeOutAgent</code>.)
<p>

The <code>channel.set_volume()</code> system is somewhat limited. You cannot
schedule two volume changes on the same channel at the same time. 
Overlapping volume changes will sound wrong, as the later change
pre-empts the first. In fact, if a volume change even begins too soon after
the previous one ends (on a given channel), the results will not be exactly
right. The lesson here is that volume changes should not be used for
frequent, short-term effects on a channel. Keep them a few seconds apart.
<p>

On the other hand, there's no problem with volume changes on 
<em>different</em> channels. It is perfectly fine for two agents to be
running, each creating its own channels, and fading them in and out 
independently. They will not interfere with each other. In fact, it may
be that (unbeknownst to them) the root channel is slowly fading out.
<p>

(You may wonder what happens when a note is playing in a channel, inside
another channel, inside the root channel, and each of these has its own
volume level. Simply: the loudness of a note is found by multiplying its
own volume (the volume passed to <code>sched_note()</code>) by the
volume of every channel it is inside. The default volume, 1, has no effect
on the final product. On the other hand, if any channel has volume zero,
the product will be zero. This is what we expect: you can silence a note
by silencing the root channel, or the channel that directly contains the
note, or any channel in between.)
<p>

This brings up one final, somewhat abstract question: who is in charge
of a channel's volume? Since two agents trying to change the volume
of a single channel will interfere with each other, we need a guideline.
<p>

The general guideline is: an agent takes responsibility for controlling
the volume of the channels it creates. An agent should <em>not</em>
try to change the volume of the channel it is running <em>in</em>.
<p>

This is because, in general, an agent does not know what other agents
might be running in the channel with it. If they all tried to manipulate
that channel's volume, none of them would get what they wanted. Instead,
if you want to mess with channel volumes, do what we do in the examples
above: create a channel for your own use, run agents in it, and change
the volume of that channel.
<p>

This does not mean that it is absolutely forbidden for an agent to change
or stop its own channel. <code>ExampleFadeOut</code> above does just that.
But it is part of a system of agents that make up a soundscape. In fact,
<code>Example</code> is employing it for the specific purpose of changing
the volume of the channel that <code>Example</code> created.
<p>

But it would be a bad idea for <code>Example</code> to call
<code>self.channel.set_volume(0)</code>. <code>Example</code> is a complete
soundscape, and some other soundscape might want to invoke it running in
a channel with several other agents.
