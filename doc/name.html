<h2>Boodler: About the Name</h2>

Boodler was inspired by many things. (Not least a very long drive
from Durham to Pittsburgh. And back. Three times in two weeks.)
But one great inspiration was <code>Looching</code>, a strange
soundscape generator implemented many years ago for the NeXT.
<p>

<code>Looching</code> was named after Looch, the author's dog.
<p>

I don't have a dog. However, my friends 
<a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/index.html">Ginohn</a>
have a dog. They live halfway between Durham and Pittsburgh.
The dog's name is 
<a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/pix/Booda.html">Booda</a>.
<p>

It's good enough for me.

<h3>Other Boodler</h3>

Bruce Sterling, in 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Hacker_Crackdown/Hacker_Crackdown_HTML/crack_6.html">The Hacker Crackdown</a>,
mentions that "boodler" was 19th-century street slang for "counterfeiter".
<p>

"Boodlers" is a musical group featuring Elliott Sharp.
