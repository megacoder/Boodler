<h2>Boodler: Other Soundscape Tricks</h2>

<h3>Agents with arguments</h3>

We slipped a sneakery past you, a few sections back. Consider the line

<pre>
        ag = FadeOutAgent(3)
</pre>

This creates an instance of an agent class, but it passes in an argument
as it does so. <code>FadeOutAgent</code> has a (mandatory) argument, which
is the duration of the fade-out that occurs before the channel stops.
<p>

This is a nice trick, and you will sometimes want to create your own
agents that take arguments. You do this by adding a constructor
method to your class. 

<pre>
class Example2(Agent):
    name = 'repeat example'
    def __init__(self, pitch, reptime):
        Agent.__init__(self)
        self.pitch = float(pitch)
        self.reptime = float(reptime)
    def run(self):
        self.sched_note('environ/droplet-plink.aiff', self.pitch)
        self.resched(self.reptime)

class Example(Agent):
    name = 'repeat example'
    def run(self):
        ag = Example2(1.5, 0.5)
        self.sched_agent(ag)
        ag = Example2(1, 1.21)
        self.sched_agent(ag)
</pre>

The <code>Example</code> agent creates two instances of 
<code>Example2</code>. The first has a high pitch (1.5) and a short
repeat time (half a second). The other has a lower pitch and a longer
repeat time (1.21 seconds). Both are scheduled to start immediately,
so you hear a quick high plinking interspersed with a low, slower sound.
<p>

Here is how the constructor in <code>Example2</code> works:
<p>

In Python, the constructor is always called <code>__init__()</code>.
The first argument is <code>self</code>; it is followed by any arguments
you want the caller to pass in.

<pre>        Agent.__init__(self)</pre>

The first line of <code>__init__()</code> <em>must</em> be this call.
It calls the general agent setup code. If you neglect this line, you
will get a <code>ScheduleError: agent is uninitialized</code> exception.
<p>

The remainder of the constructor is yours to do with as you will. 
But remember that <code>__init__()</code> is called when the agent instance
is created. This is <em>before</em> the agent is scheduled, 
placed in a channel, or set running. Therefore, the <code>__init__()</code>
method cannot
schedule notes or agents, or create channels, or do anything else
that affects the stream of sound.
(If you think you want to do these things, you probably really
want to create a separate agent class that does them in its
<code>run()</code> method.)
<p>

Most often, your <code>__init__()</code> method will just take its
arguments and store them away for <code>run()</code> time. In the example,
we take the <code>pitch</code> argument and attach it to the agent instance,
as <code>self.pitch</code>. We do the same with <code>reptime</code>.
<p>

Note that we call <code>float()</code> on <code>pitch</code> and
<code>reptime</code> to convert
them to real numbers. It is not obvious why this is necessary -- after all,
Python automatically converts integers to real numbers when needed.
<p>

The reason is so that you can type this command:

<pre>
python boodler.py bootest.Example2 1.25 0.75
</pre>

When you run Boodler, all command-line arguments after the class name
are passed on to the class as constructor arguments. However, they are
passed as strings. (The Boodler startup mechanism cannot know that they
are meant to be interpreted as numbers, so it can't convert them
automatically.) If you think your agent might ever be run from the
command line, it is polite to accept string values for your numeric
arguments, by using the <code>float()</code> or <code>int()</code>
functions to convert them.
<p>

An optional argument is easy to arrange:

<pre>
class Example2(Agent):
    name = 'repeat example'
    def __init__(self, pitch=1, reptime=1):
        Agent.__init__(self)
        self.pitch = float(pitch)
        self.reptime = float(reptime)
    def run(self):
        self.sched_note('environ/droplet-plink.aiff', self.pitch)
        self.resched(self.reptime)
</pre>

The line

<pre>    def __init__(self, pitch=1, reptime=1):</pre>

gives default values for both arguments, making them optional. If you
run the <code>Example2</code> agent from the command line without
parameters, or do <code>ag = Example2()</code> in Python code, the
agent will default to pitch 1.0 and a one-second repeat time.
If you supply just one argument, it will be taken as the pitch,
and the repeat time will default to 1.
<p>

<h3>Panning sounds and channels</h3>

You can control the stereo location of a sound by using the
<code>sched_note_pan()</code> method instead of <code>sched_note()</code>.
This method has an extra argument (after the sound), which indicates
how far left or right to play the sound.

<pre>
    self.sched_note_pan('environ/droplet-plink.aiff', 1.0)
    self.sched_note_pan('environ/droplet-plink.aiff', -1.0, 1, 1, 0.5)
</pre>

The value -1.0 indicates a sound played entirely in the left channel;
1.0 means the right channel; 0.0 is center, the normal position.
<p>

(The usual optional arguments of pitch, volume, delay, and channel can
follow the pan location. The second line above plays a note in the left
channel, normal pitch, normal volume, and 0.5 seconds after the first note.)
<p>

Just as a channel can modify the volume of every sound within it, a
channel can modify the stereo location of every sound within it.

<pre>
    chan = self.new_channel_pan(0.5)
</pre>

This creates a channel shifted halfway to the right. A sound played
in this channel with <code>sched_note()</code> would be played at
position 0.5, instead of the default (center) position. A sound played
at location -1.0 would come out at position -0.5.
<p>

You can control the stereo location of a channel more precisely using 
the functions in the <code>stereo</code> module. For example:

<pre>
    from boodle import stereo
    chan = self.new_channel_pan(stereo.fixed(0.5))
</pre>

This channel renders <em>all</em> sounds within it, no matter where they
think they're going, at location 0.5.
<p>

See the <a href="design-ref.html">Programming Reference</a> for more
about the <code>stereo</code> module. You can use these functions
to shift a channel, or compress it into a narrow range, or even swap
the left and right channels. I leave the details to your enjoyment.
