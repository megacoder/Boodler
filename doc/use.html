<h2>Boodler: Using It</h2>

First, make sure you have downloaded the Boodler source and 
sound library packages; 
compiled and installed Boodler; and set the necessary
environment variables. 
(See <a href="install.html">Installing Boodler</a>.)
<p>

The use of Boodler, in its simplest form, is, um, simple:
<p>
<pre>
boodler.py module.ClassName
</pre>
<p>

...where <code>module</code> is one of the files in
<code>$BOODLER_EFFECTS_PATH</code> (without the <code>.py</code>
suffix), and ClassName is one of the <code>Agent</code> classes
in that file. For example:
<p>
<pre>
boodler.py crows.ParliamentOfCrows
</pre>
<p>

Most <code>Agent</code> classes produce an unending stream of sound,
causing Boodler to run forever (or until you hit ctrl-C). Some 
agents, however, come to a conclusion and shut themselves
down. If you tell Boodler to run such an agent, Boodler will exit
when the agent is finished.
<p>

<h3>Running agent classes with arguments</h3>

Some <code>Agent</code> classes take additional options, which you can
add to the command line after the class name. For example, 
<p>
<pre>
boodler.py play.OneSound environ/droplet-bloink.aiff
</pre>
<p>

<code>play.OneSound</code> is an agent which takes exactly one argument --
the name of a sound -- and plays it once, and then exits. (The sound
is searched for in <code>$BOODLER_SOUND_PATH</code>.)
<p>

<code>play.OneSound</code> requires one argument -- you will get an error
if you try to pass none (or two or more). 
Some <code>Agent</code> classes, however, have optional arguments --
or both mandatory and optional arguments. If you try
<p>
<pre>
boodler.py play.OneSoundOpts environ/droplet-bloink.aiff</pre>
<p>
...you will hear exactly the same "bloink" noise as in the previous
example. However, <code>play.OneSoundOpts</code> takes up to three
additional arguments: the pitch, the volume, and the stereo (left-right)
shift. You may do
<p>
<pre>
boodler.py play.OneSoundOpts environ/droplet-bloink.aiff 0.5 0.75 -1.0</pre>
<p>
...to hear this sound played an octave lower, at 75% volume, and shifted
entirely to the left speaker channel.
<p>

Some <code>Agent</code> classes take arguments which are themselves the
names of other <code>Agent</code> classes. Try this:
<p>
<pre>
boodler.py manager.Simultaneous crows.ParliamentOfCrows wind.Windstorm
</pre>
<p>

The <code>manager.Simultaneous</code> agent takes as arguments any number
of <code>Agent</code> classes; it sets them all playing at the same
time. In this case, you get a bunch of crows complaining about the blustery
weather.
<p>

(There is currently no way to pass arguments to any agents which are
themselves arguments. You cannot, for example, say
<p>
<pre>
boodler.py manager.Simultaneous wind.Windstorm play.OneSound environ/droplet-bloink.aiff</pre>
<p>
...because <code>manager.Simultaneous</code> will just think that
<code>environ/droplet-bloink.aiff</code> is supposed to be a third 
agent. I may come up with a way around this in some future release.
In the meantime, it is trivial to write your own agent which accomplishes
this simultaneity. See <a href="design.html">Designing New Soundscapes</a>.)

<h3><a name="events">Sending events to Boodler</a></h3>

Some Agent classes can receive events, or messages, sent by other programs.
Boodler listens on a network socket for these messages if you give the
<code>--listen</code> argument. (If you do not, Boodler does <em>not</em>
listen for events, and event-receiving agents will not run.
This is the default behavior for reasons of security paranoia.)
<p>

To send an event, use
the <code>boomsg.py</code> program:
<p>

<pre>
boomsg.py go
</pre>
<p>

This sends a simple message <code>('go')</code> to a listening Boodler
process -- by default, on the same machine. To send a message to a 
different machine, you would say:
<p>

<pre>
boomsg.py --hostname machine.addr.net go
</pre>
<p>

You can also send a more complex message, with several words:
<p>

<pre>
boomsg.py go 5.47 cheese
</pre>
<p>

The effect of an event depends on what agent has been posted to receive it.
For examples of Agent classes that receive events,
see the <code>listen</code> module in the list of soundscapes.
<p>

<h3>What soundscapes are there?</h3>

<a href="catalog.html">Here is the list of sound agents</a> which come
with Boodler.
<p>

<h3>Choosing an output driver</h3>

By default, Boodler uses an appropriate sound device for your computer.
(The OSS library on Unixes; CoreAudio on MacOSX.) But there are
many output drivers available. To see which ones were compiled
in your Boodler installation:
<p>

<pre>
boodler.py --list-drivers
</pre>
<p>

You can adjust the behavior of each driver with various command-line
arguments. Most understand the <code>--rate</code> and
<code>--device</code> arguments (although the meaning of the latter
depends on the driver). Some drivers also accept additional arguments,
using the <code>--define <em>opt</em></code> or
<code>--define <em>opt=val</em></code> command-line arguments. (Use 
<code>--hardware</code> to show the driver details.)<p>

Boodler currently offers these drivers:

<h4><code>file</code> --   write file containing raw sample output</h4>

The file will be named "boosound.raw" by default. To change this, pass
a filename as the <code>--device</code>.
<p>

The file will contain raw PCM sound sample data, two channels, 16 bits
per sample, signed (centered at 0). By default the samples will be
in the native endianness of your computer, but you can change this with
<code>--define end=big</code> or <code>--define end=little</code>.
<p>

This driver limits the size of the file. By default, it will only write
five seconds of sound data; you can change the limit with the
<code>--define time=<em>interval</em></code> option. If the
sound agent stops before the time limit, you'll get a shorter file.
<p>

(Note that this driver writes to the file as quickly as possible.
It probably won't take five seconds to generate a five-second
sound file.)
<p>

<dl>
<dt><code>--define time=<em>interval</em></code>
<dd>Generate approximately <em>interval</em> seconds of output. 
This defaults to five seconds.
<dt><code>--define end=big</code>
<dd>Force the sound output to be written big-endian.
<dt><code>--define end=little</code>
<dd>Force the sound output to be written little-endian.
</dl>

<h4><code>stdout</code> -- write raw sample output to stdout</h4>

This is similar to the <code>file</code> driver, but it streams its
data to stdout, and there is no time limit. The 
<code>--device</code> argument is ignored.
<p>

The <code>stdout</code> driver, like the <code>file</code> driver,
generates sound data as quickly as possible. This will probably
be much faster than real time! If you pipe the output to a file,
you will have a very large file very soon. This driver is intended
to be piped to an application that can regulate its input, such as
<a href="http://www.icecast.org/ices.php">Ices</a>.
<p>

<dl>
<dt><code>--define end=big</code>
<dd>Force the sound output to be written big-endian.
<dt><code>--define end=little</code>
<dd>Force the sound output to be written little-endian.
</dl>

<h4><code>oss</code> --    Open Sound System</h4>

This is the default output driver on Linux and other Unixes.
Use <code>--device</code> to control which audio hardware device
is used; the default is <code>/dev/dsp</code>.
<p>

<h4><code>alsa</code> --   Advanced Linux Sound Architecture</h4>

Another Unix sound framework. Use <code>--device</code> to control which
ALSA device is used; the default is <code>default</code>.
<p>

<dl>
<dt><code>--define buffersize=<em>frames</em></code>
<dd>Define the length of Boodler's generation buffer, in frames.
The default is 4096.
<dt><code>--define hwbuffer=<em>frames</em></code>
<dd>Define the length of the ALSA sound buffer, in frames. The default
is 16384. If you find that the sound skips when the CPU is busy,
increase this value. The hwbuffer should not be shorter than the buffersize.
<dt><code>--define periodsize=<em>frames</em></code>
<dd>Define the length of the ALSA transfer period. This should be a
fraction of the buffersize. The default is left up to the ALSA
driver; it depends on the buffersize.
</dl>

<h4><code>esd</code> --    Enlightened Sound Daemon</h4>

Yet another Unix sound framework. The <code>--device</code> option defines 
the hostname to send sound to; it defaults to <code>localhost</code>.
If no ESD daemon is running, this will attempt to write directly to
<code>/dev/dsp</code>.
<p>

<h4><code>macosx</code> -- MacOSX CoreAudio</h4>

This is the default output driver on MacOSX.
<p>

<dl>
<dt><code>--define buffercount=<em>count</em></code>
<dd>Create a queue of <em>count</em> buffers. If you find that the
sound skips when the CPU is busy (for example, when you're dragging
or resizing windows), increase this value. The default is 6.
<dt><code>--define buffersize=<em>size</em></code>
<dd>Set each CoreAudio buffer to be <em>size</em> bytes long.
The default is 32768. (I have found that using a value of 65536
or more causes clicking; I'm not sure why.)
</dl>

<h4><code>vorbis</code> -- write Ogg Vorbis file</h4>

This writes a file, like the <code>file</code> driver; but it
generates an Ogg Vorbis file. The default filename is "boosound.ogg".
To change this, pass a filename as the <code>--device</code>.
<p>

<dl>
<dt><code>--define time=<em>interval</em></code>
<dd>Generate approximately <em>interval</em> seconds of output. 
This defaults to five seconds.
<dt><code>--define quality=<em>val</em></code>
<dd>Set the Vorbis VBR compression quality, from 0.0 (low bitrate and 
quality) to 1.0 (high).
</dl>

<h4><code>shout</code> --  Shoutcast or Icecast source</h4>

This generates an Ogg Vorbis stream, and sends it to a Shoutcast or
Icecast server (using 
<a href="http://www.icecast.org/download.php">libshout</a>).
<p>

<dl>
<dt><code>--define shout-server=<em>name</em></code>
<dd>Connect to shoutcast or icecast server <em>name</em>. Can be a
domain or an IP address. Defaults to "127.0.0.1".
<dt><code>--define shout-port=<em>port</em></code>
<dd>Use port <em>port</em> on the streaming server. Defaults to 8000.
<dt><code>--define shout-user=<em>name</em></code>
<dd>Login with username <em>user</em> to the server. Defaults to "source".
<dt><code>--define shout-password=<em>password</em></code>
<dd>Login with password <em>password</em> to the server. Defaults to "hackme".
<dt><code>--define shout-mount=<em>mount</em></code>
<dd>With an icecast server, mount the sound on <em>mount</em>. Defaults to "/boodler.ogg".
<dt><code>--define shout-protocol=<em>type</em></code>
<dd>Use <em>type</em> as the protocol. Use "http" for icecast2,
"xaudiocast" for icecast1, and "icy" for a shoutcast server. Defaults to "http".
<dt><code>--define quality=<em>val</em></code>
<dd>Set the Vorbis VBR compression quality, from 0.0 (low bitrate and 
quality) to 1.0 (high).
</dl>

<h4><code>lame</code> -- write MP3 file with LAME encoder</h4>

This writes a file, like the <code>file</code> driver; but it
generates an MP3 file. The default filename is "boosound.mp3".
To change this, pass a filename as the <code>--device</code>.
<p>

<dl>
<dt><code>--define time=<em>interval</em></code>
<dd>Generate approximately <em>interval</em> seconds of output. 
This defaults to five seconds.
<dt><code>--define quality=<em>val</em></code>
<dd>Set the LAME VBR compression quality, from 9 (low bitrate and 
quality) to 0 (high). Yes, it's backwards. The default is 2.
<dt><code>--define fast</code>
<dd>Use a faster VBR encoding algorithm. (Reduces quality somewhat.)
<dt><code>--define abr=<em>rate</em></code>
<dd>Use ABR (fixed average bit rate) of <em>rate</em> KBPS.
The <em>rate</em> can be from 8 to 320.
<dt><code>--define haste=<em>val</em></code>
<dd>Modify the speed of the encoding algorithm, from 0 (slow and careful)
to 9 (hasty). This affects the quality (but not the bit rate) of the output. 
The default is 2.
</dl>

<h3>All the obscure options</h3>

<pre>
boodler.py [ options ] module.AgentClass [ data ... ]
</pre>

<dl>

<dt><code>--output <em>driver</em></code>
<dd>Select one of the available driver modules.
The default is <code>oss</code> on Unix, or <code>macosx</code> on
MacOSX.

<dt><code>--list-drivers</code>
<dd>List the driver modules which are available. Any of the listed
drivers may be used with the <code>--output</code> option.

<dt><code>--device <em>device</em></code>
<dd>Set the device which Boodler will write to. The details depend on
which driver module you have selected.

<dt><code>--list-devices</code>
<dd>List the devices which are available for this driver module.
(Not all drivers provide such a list.)

<dt><code>--rate <em>soundrate</em></code>
<dd>Set the sampling rate (in frames per second) which Boodler will try
to use. If the sound device does not support this rate, Boodler will try
to fall back upon some sampling rate which is supported. The 
default depends on the output driver, but may be 44100.

<dt><code>--master <em>volume</em></code>
<dd>Set the master mixing volume for all sounds. The default is 0.5.
You should <em>not</em> increase this. If you do, any soundscapes that
play more than one sound at a time (most of them) are likely to suffer from 
clipping noise -- sporadic static. 
(To increase Boodler's volume, you should use a mixer application to
adjust your sound driver, or just turn up your speakers.)
If you hear clipping noise in complex
soundscapes, try <em>reducing</em> this option below 0.5.

<dt><code>--verbose</code>
<dd>Turn on verbose handling of exceptions. Normally, if an exception
occurs in the execution of an agent, Boodler just prints the name of
the exception and continues running. If you set <code>--verbose</code>,
Boodler will print out the entire Python stack trace.

<dt><code>--hardware</code>
<dd>Display the capabilities of your sound hardware at startup time.
This shows you explicitly what sample format and frame rate Boodler is
using. It also dumps whatever other information about the sound
interface might (conceivably) be important.

<dt><code>--stats <em>interval</em></code>
<dd>Turn on periodic statistics reporting. At intervals (given in
seconds), Boodler will print out a message saying how many agents,
channels, sounds, and note are queued up. This may be helpful for
debugging soundscapes; if you see a value which increases without
limit, you probably have a bug.

<dt><code>--listen</code>
<dd>Cause Boodler to listen for events on a network socket (port 31863).
Agents can be triggered by these events. See <a href="#events">above</a>.

<dt><code>--port <em>port</em></code>
<dd>If <code>--listen</code> is used, this causes Boodler to listen
on the given port number (instead of the default port 31863). 
The port may also be an absolute pathname (beginning with "/"),
in which case Boodler uses a Unix domain socket instead of a network
socket.

<dt><code>--define <em>opt</em></code>
<dd>

<dt><code>--define <em>opt=val</em></code>
<dd>Pass an option in to the sound driver. The available options
depend on which driver Boodler is compiled with.
Note that if an <em>=val</em> is supplied, there may not be any spaces
before or after the equals sign. See the previous section
for the meaning of the many options.
