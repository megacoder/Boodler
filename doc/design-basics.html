<h2>Boodler: Soundscape Basics</h2>

Boodler is written in Python; each soundscape is one or more pieces
of Python code. If you wish to write your own, you will have to
write some Python.
<p>

If you don't know Python, you get to learn some. This is unlikely to hurt
much. If you only want to accomplish simple tasks, you can probably
cut-and-paste them together from examples in this document. (If you
want to do something complicated, you would have had to learn some
programming or scripting language anyway.)
<p>

<h3>Some quick Python notes</h3>

I will not attempt to teach Python here. Tutorials, reference manuals,
and other tasty things can be found on the
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python web site</a>, and I commend
you to them. However, if you're a complete Python newbie and you
just want to experiment with Boodler, here are tips:
<p>

Python cares about indentation. (This is just about the only stupid
thing about Python, and I suffer it willingly, but I don't pass up
any opportunity to complain either. :-) If you're writing or editing
a Python source file, you must keep the indentation consistent. If
two lines are indented the same distance in an example, they'd better
be indented the same distance in your code. 
<p>

You can use either the tab key or the space bar to indent lines, but
don't mix them in the same file. That leads to pain.
<p>

(Note: these rules are overly conservative. I am simplifying for the
sake of the Python newbie. If you know how to mix tab indentation and
space indentation safely, for heavens' sakes, go ahead.)
<p>

Back to Boodler.
<p>

<h3>Fundamental concepts</h3>

Boodler deals with agents, channels, and notes.
<p>

A note is a particular sound file -- an AIFF, WAV, or AU -- played at 
a particular time. You can also specify a pitch, a volume, and some other
parameters; or you can leave these at defaults.
<p>

An agent is a piece of Python code that schedules notes and other agents.
The agent decides which notes to play when, and which agents to start
up when. An agent can also create channels.
<p>

A channel is a collection of notes, agents, and channels. When Boodler
starts up, there is exactly one channel, the "root channel". An agent
can create new channels inside the root channel -- and then go on to
create channels inside those channels, and so on. The channels thus
form a tree, with a single root.
<p>

The initial agent -- the one you specify first on the command line -- 
runs inside the root channel. Normally, when an agent schedules notes 
(or other agents), the notes are played (and the agents run)
in the same channel as the original agent. However, an agent
can create a new channel, and then place notes and other agents inside
the new channel.
<p>

Why all this foofaraw with channels? Because you can make a change to
a channel, and that change will affect every note inside that channel --
including notes in channels inside channels inside it. (And so on.)
For example,
you can mute a channel (set its volume to zero) and thereby silence
it and all its contents. Or you could set its volume to 50%, which would mute
all its contents by half. Or you could simply kill the channel; this
would stop (and destroy) all notes and agents that are running inside it.
<p>

(The root channel, of course, ultimately contains <em>every</em> note,
agent, and channel. So if you kill the root channel, Boodler shuts down.)

<h3>Sound properties</h3>

The point of Boodler is to play specified notes at specified times. As
we have said, each note is taken from a sound file, but you can modify
the way a note is played. Boodler lets you specify five parameters for a
note: time, pitch, volume, pan, and (for some sound files) duration.
<p>

<dl>

<dt>Time
<dd>This is simply the time at which the sound begins playing. Time
zero is when Boodler starts up. Time is always specified in seconds.
(Fractional values, such as 0.1 or 1.5, are legitimate.)
<p>

Notes are always scheduled by agents, and agents run at a particular
time. Therefore, when you specify a time, you always specify a 
<em>relative</em> time; 1.0 means "one second from now". The "now"
is the time at which the agent runs.
<p>

<dt>Pitch
<dd>Whether the note is higher or lower -- imagine a piano keyboard.
<p>

Sadly for the musically trained in our audience, 
pitch is not given in familiar musical notation -- you do not
specify "D" or "A flat". (This might not even be meaningful;
what does it mean to play a rainstorm in B minor?) Instead, you
specify pitch as a frequency multiplier. The value 1.0 means to 
play the sound in its original pitch -- the same pitch that is heard
in the sound file it is taken from. The value 2.0 means to play
the sound at twice the frequency. The value 0.5 means half the frequency,
and so on.
<p>

The physics of musical sound indicate that for every doubling of frequency,
the pitch rises by one octave. Pitch 0.5 is an octave down; pitch 2.0 is
an octave up; pitch 4.0 is two octaves up; pitch 8.0 is three octaves up.
<p>

Since the entire waveform of the sound is sped up or slowed down, the
duration of the sound changes. A sound played at pitch 2.0 will last half
as long as the same sound played at 1.0; the same sound at pitch 0.25 will
last four times as long. (This corresponds with your intuition that
slowed-down sounds last longer. Just like on a record player that's running
down. Um, remember record players? Sigh.)
<p>

You can specify any pitch greater than (but not equal to) zero. However,
a value too close to zero or infinity will be inaudible.
<p>

<dt>Volume
<dd>Whether the note is louder or softer. The value 1.0 indicates the
sound's original volume. Volume 0.5 indicates half volume; 0.0 indicates
a completely inaudible sound.
<p>

It is legal to play sounds at a volume greater than 1, but you risk overdriving
the digital sound stream, which produces horrible static (clipping noise).
In general, you should not do this.

<dt>Duration
<dd>The pitch of a sound always affects its duration. But with some
sounds, you can extend the duration without changing the pitch.
<p>

For this to work, the sound must have looping information embedded 
in it. (At this time, Python's sound-loading modules can only extract
looping information from AIFF files. And not all AIFF files have loop
parameters.)
<p>

Basically, the looping info specifies a segment of the sound which can be
repeated over and over to extend its duration. This works better for some
sounds than for others. For example, a trumpet blare can easily be looped --
the beginning isn't much different from the end, so looping a segment
isn't noticeable. A long roll of thunder can probably be looped, but
the grumbles might start to sound repetitive if the sound is extended
too far. A plucked guitar string would not loop very well at all; 
the sound dies off smoothly, so looping any segment would lead to an
audible "seam".
<p>

Some of the sounds in the Boodler sound library are looped, and some are
not. It depends on how suited they are to loop-extension.
<p>

<dt>Pan
<dd>Boodler can play both monaural and stereo sound files. It can also
pan (shift) these sounds towards the left or right. 
For mono sounds, this is straightforward: a pan value of 0 means the
sound is played equally through both speakers; -1 means it is heard only
in the left speaker; 1 means it is heard only on the right. Intermediate
values cause a partial shifting. A value greater than 1 or less than -1 is
just treated as 1 or -1, respectively.
<p>

(Note that these changes are done by muting one speaker or the other.
A mono sound played at pan 1 will sound quieter to the listener than the same
sound at pan 0, because the left speaker has been silenced, but the right
has been left unchanged. (It might make more sense to double the volume
of the right speaker, but that would run into clipping problems, so we
don't bother.))
<p>

<dt>Stereo Panning
<dd>
(This isn't actually all that basic, so you might want to skip it
for now.)
<p>

A stereo sound is treated as two separate mono sounds: one at pan -1,
one at pan 1. This makes intuitive sense; we hear the left channel
of the sound only through the left speaker, and the right channel
only on the right.
<p>

Unfortunately the picture gets more complicated when you try to pan a
stereo sound. If you play a stereo sound at pan 1, 
the left channel is now centered (pan 0), while the
right channel is at 2, which is treated the same as 1, meaning all the way
right. The sound will appear to have shifted right, but only partially.
<p>

To make things worse, you can <em>contract</em> a stereo sound as well
as shifting it. For example, you could take the original sound and
play the left channel at -0.5, and the right channel at 0.5. The sound is
still centered, but the two channels are closer together than before.
You could even contract it <em>completely</em>, merging both channels 
at pan position 0.
<p>

Or you can combine a contraction with a shift. If you contract a stereo
sound by a factor of 0.5, and then shift it -0.25, you'll wind up with the
left channel at -0.75 and the right channel at 0.25. 
<p>

The especially geeky will recognize this as a one-dimensional
affine transform, similar to the 2D transforms used in PostScript or the
3D transforms used in computer graphics modelling.
Is this not overkill for playing sounds in stereo?
<p>

Well, maybe. The advantage is this: you can treat an entire soundscape --
a Boodler channel -- as a very complex stereo sound. It may have a mixture
of mono and stereo sounds, each played at a different pan position. But
this entire range of positions can still be shifted or compressed, just like
a single sound.
<p>

This is, in a nutshell, the power of Boodler. You can build up a complex
effect in a channel, and then <em>use</em> it as a single component in
another complex effect.
